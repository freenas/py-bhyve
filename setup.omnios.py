# There doesn't seem to be any way to get both Cython and the linker to see the
# library at version 1; explicit linker flags cause Cython to miss the library and
# we have missing symbols, with ldd showing the library wasn't ever asked for
# Conversely the documentation here:
# https://python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/distutils/apiref.html#distutils.core.Extension
# requires a library name, not path, and this will cause the linker to fail as 
# we have libvmmapi.so.1 and not libvmmapi.so, but which does mean the library is
# found and linked in.
# A really hacky solution is just to symlink to the required file and add the
# pwd ot the search path; this hopefully shouldn't carry through to runtime and
# the output according to ldd is linked up correctly to /lib/amd64/libvmmapi.so.1
